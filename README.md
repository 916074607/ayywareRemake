# ayywareRemake

- FOR ALL THESE GUYS JUST WANT TO PLAY WITH DLL SOME INFO:
- There is a Default Resolver thats active always, the Extra Resolver is just some kind "Extra"
- Tank AA usage: If you press ALT Key on your Keyboard your Fake Head Side will change RIGHT/LEFT
- Hitscan mode is auto so its useless to change there some Settings.
- If you Press Shift on your Keyboard u have a FAKEWALK.
- If you use Autowall DMG == 100; it will use Enemy HP always example if EnemyHP is 20 or 100.
